# Status — 2026-09-07

Step 0 complete. Step 1: rebrand reviewed and merged; approvals and tickets are undergoing independent acceptance review. Step 2 has not started.

- Fork: https://github.com/Adanmohh/codeg
- Project root: `/Users/mohamedadan/projects/ops-desk`
- Branch: `main`, based on `v0.30.4` (`6f6bd648b206412644842a98d9ffeebf57292bed`).
- Original fork tip preserved as `archive/upstream-main-at-fork`.
- FOUNDING.md and ORCHESTRATOR.md preserved; versions and initialization decisions recorded in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md).
- Validation: frozen frontend dependency installation, default desktop `cargo check --locked`, frontend production build (32 static pages), and standalone `tsc --noEmit` all exited 0. Evidence and known upstream warnings: [reports/step0.md](reports/step0.md).
- Step 0 product source and lockfiles matched the upstream tag. Rebrand is now merged; both dependency lockfiles and Apache LICENSE remain unchanged. No AGPL source imported.
- Herdr environment verified and CLI syntax read. No workers started for Step 0.

## Step 1 — dispatched 2026-09-07

All three workers were dispatched through Herdr, each in its own worktree and branch from `2f74992e`. Each topic has a separate tab in the Ops Desk workspace (`wR`), with its worker pane inside. Orchestrator: `wR:t1`, pane `wR:p1`.

| Worker | Tab / pane | Branch | Worktree | Report | Review / merge |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| rebrand | `wR:t2` / `wR:p2` | `feat/step1-rebrand` | `/Users/mohamedadan/projects/_worktrees/ops-desk/rebrand` | `reports/rebrand.md` | Reviewed and merged, PR #2 |
| approvals | `wR:t3` / `wR:p3` | `feat/step1-approvals` | `/Users/mohamedadan/projects/_worktrees/ops-desk/approvals` | `reports/approvals.md` in worktree | PR #3, independent review running |
| tickets | `wR:t4` / `wR:p4` | `feat/step1-tickets` | `/Users/mohamedadan/projects/_worktrees/ops-desk/tickets` | `reports/tickets.md` in worktree | PR #1, independent review running |

- Verified all four active project agents use `gpt-6-astra`, the most capable model in the installed Codex model catalogue. Owner requires the best current models for all project workers; no cheaper-model delegation.
- Worker launch arguments explicitly set `-a never -s danger-full-access`.
- Every prompt requires complete founding/orchestration document reads, docs-first pinned-source reads, exact-source borrowing, licence/NOTICE attribution, no AGPL or enterprise source, early commits/pushes, draft PRs to main, and committed file reports.
- Review gates: default desktop `cargo check --locked`, frontend typecheck, focused behavioral tests and server compilation for Rust changes; inspect source citations and licence provenance before accepting.
- The orchestrator writes no product code. Update this file after each review and merge. Step 2 has not started.

- Owner docs-research update relayed to every worker: use `gh api` for latest documentation research and record exact refs; retain mandated borrowed-source pins.

- Docs-first hook audit found Claude-only registration. Added and trusted a scoped Codex adapter; five smoke tests passed. All three workers pushed checkpoints and resumed; live PreToolUse and PostToolUse records verified for each session. Details: [reports/docs-first-hook.md](reports/docs-first-hook.md).

- All three workers resumed on explicit `gpt-6-astra` with `model_reasoning_effort=max`, keeping `never` approval and full access. All implementation handoffs are complete; acceptance state is recorded below.

## Owner integration amendment — 2026-09-07

Step 2 now borrows direct Resend REST email transport and GitHub App integration from intromail. No Resend CLI/MCP or GitHub MCP product integration. Exact sources and missing polling/create-issue glue documented in FOUNDING.md and DECISIONS.md. Step 1 scope remains branding, approvals/audit and ticket store/threading.

## Acceptance review — rebrand merged, 2026-09-07

- Rebrand [PR #2](https://github.com/Adanmohh/codeg/pull/2) reviewed at `9d036d47ab7a7cebecfac78204aa915eb5ffe8ba` and merged as `079fbf64bcfd8116e83499b5b2e818f95ab84535`.
- Orchestrator inspected the report, attribution, update-disable boundaries, display changes and mobile screenshot. Independently reran desktop/server `cargo check --locked`, frontend typecheck and four focused frontend suites: 71 tests passed. No blocking findings. Worker build/lint/native test evidence remains in [reports/rebrand.md](reports/rebrand.md).
- Existing sidecar-placeholder and Rust future-compatibility warnings remain; no native packaged-app validation or CI-pass claim.
- Approvals worker is independently reviewing tickets; tickets worker is independently reviewing approvals. Each must deliver a review file with findings and exact reviewed commit. Neither implementation is accepted or merged yet. Shared NOTICE/registry integration and combined checks remain.

## Remaining Step 1 acceptance

- Tickets [PR #1](https://github.com/Adanmohh/codeg/pull/1), head `c2dc3be58b0e98999360fa23565aac8a3fe25fb6`: worker reports desktop/server compile, typecheck, Clippy and 15 focused tests passing. Independent reviewer: approvals worker; deliverable `reports/review-tickets.md` in approvals worktree.
- Approvals [PR #3](https://github.com/Adanmohh/codeg/pull/3), head `a4b418837d0b28e5ead6e57de1a8dbddc96ec1ba`: worker reports desktop/server compile, typecheck, Clippy, 19 approval tests and 39 work-task tests passing. Independent reviewer: tickets worker; deliverable `reports/review-approvals.md` in tickets worktree.
- Both PRs remain draft/unmerged. Rebrand introduced a shared NOTICE conflict; preserve all attribution when integrating. Review findings must be fixed by the owning worker, then checked before merge. GitHub has no attached status checks; worker local passes are not CI passes.
- Step 1 is the foundation, not the complete support/bug workflow. Step 2 supplies email transport/UI, Hafidh intake, evidence-bound GitHub App issue filing, pi integration and the morning view. Step 3 supplies Telegram and end-to-end P1/P2 validation. No real email send, GitHub App installation, deployment or packaged app has been performed.
